Random Forest bergantung pada sebuah nilai vektor random dengan distribusi yang sama. Random Forest terdiri dari classifier yang berbentuk pohon {h(x, Œ∏ k ), k = 1, . . .} dimana Œ∏k adalah random vector yang diditribusikan secara independen dan masing masing tree pada sebuah unit kan memilih class yang paling popular pada input x.\n",

Ini dapat disebabkan oleh data train yang imbalance antara data neutral dengan data lainnya(negatif dan positif)."
