    "Random Forest merupakan salah satu metode dalam Decision Tree. Random Forest merupakan kombinasi masing-masing tree yang kemudian dikombinasikan ke dalam satu model. Random Forest bergantung pada sebuah nilai vektor random dengan distribusi yang sama. Random Forest terdiri dari classifier yang berbentuk pohon {h(x, Œ∏ k ), k = 1, . . .} dimana Œ∏k adalah random vector yang diditribusikan secara independen dan masing masing tree pada sebuah unit kan memilih class yang paling popular pada input x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest digunakan untuk pemilihan fitur secara random, masing-masing training set diambil dengan pengganti dari training set asli kemudian tree ditanam pada sebuah training set menggunakan seleksi fitur random. Random Forest merupakan fitur yang paling sederhana dengan membentuk fitur seleksi secara random.\n",
