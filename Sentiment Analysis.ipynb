    "Random Forest merupakan salah satu metode dalam Decision Tree. Random Forest merupakan kombinasi masing-masing tree yang kemudian dikombinasikan ke dalam satu model. Random Forest bergantung pada sebuah nilai vektor random dengan distribusi yang sama. Random Forest terdiri dari classifier yang berbentuk pohon {h(x, Œ∏ k ), k = 1, . . .} dimana Œ∏k adalah random vector yang diditribusikan secara independen dan masing masing tree pada sebuah unit kan memilih class yang paling popular pada input x.\n",
